# sneaker-bot
Sneakerbot programs for different websites

The only file that is meant for buying sneakers currently is the converse.py file. It is still unfinished as it is missing the functionality to put payment information into the appropriate fields, and there are minor bugs here and there.

Note: instagram-bot.py serves no purpose it was just a practice file to test out the selenium library before I started working on online sneaker stores.....
